ReadMe from UCI HAR: The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, we captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz. The experiments have been video-recorded to label the data manually. The obtained dataset has been randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data. 
The sensor signals (accelerometer and gyroscope) were pre-processed by applying noise filters and then sampled in fixed-width sliding windows of 2.56 sec and 50% overlap (128 readings/window). The sensor acceleration signal, which has gravitational and body motion components, was separated using a Butterworth low-pass filter into body acceleration and gravity. The gravitational force is assumed to have only low frequency components, therefore a filter with 0.3 Hz cutoff frequency was used. From each window, a vector of features was obtained by calculating variables from the time and frequency domain. See 'features_info.txt' for more details. 

# Tidy Result procedure
The result contains only variables from features containing information on the mean or the standard deviation. For every subset and 
activity the average on the variable is calculated. Subsequently the data is transformed so the variables of the original dataset all appear in 
one column called "feature" and the average scores for the unique combination of "subject" and "activity" are stored in the variable called
"mean"

### activity

- Class: Char
- Values: 'laying', 'sitting', 'standing', 'walking', 'walking_downstairs', 'walking_upstairs'
- Description: Name of the activity

### feature

- Class: Char
